Custom Configuration for c++

Instructions:

Simply run the bash script located in /src direcotry, specify the output directory and name the project


Additional Info:

Simple "Hello World" program can be generated with CMAKE upon Initialization as CMakeLists.txt is created. The "docs/" folder is empty for doxygen init. ".gitignore" made to ignore build/ and docs/ by default for when repo is initialized by user. .clang-format is written by bash script in style of Google. 

Going Forward:

Intentions are to extend the functionality to a GUI X11 C++ interface which prompts specific configurations. The underlying framework of the window is already implemented.
